# Assignment 3: Cloth Simulation

I have done my simulation in CPP using Raylib Graphics library. I used this environment as this is simple easy for me ti use and i am most familiar with it.

A and D keys are used to change angle of wind.
W and S keys are used to change speed of wind.
Left click a point to (un)fix the point.

There is a variance of 1-2% in wind to simulate real world randomness.

# I run it using this command:
```bash
g++ -g -o Assignment Assignment3.cpp -lraylib -lgdi32 -lwinmm; ./Assignment.exe
```
