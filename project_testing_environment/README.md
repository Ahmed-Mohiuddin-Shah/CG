# Zyngine - Custom Graphics Engine

This folder contains the development environment and tesing source code for **Zyngine**, a custom graphics engine being developed as part of my Computer Graphics project.

## Development Environment

- **w64devkit**: A lightweight development toolkit for Windows, providing essential tools like GCC, Make, and more.
- **raylib**: A simple and easy-to-use library for learning and developing graphics applications.

## Project Purpose

Zyngine is being built to explore and implement concepts in computer graphics, such as rendering, transformations, and custom shaders. The goal is to create a functional and efficient graphics engine while gaining hands-on experience with low-level graphics programming.

## How to Build and Run

1. Ensure `w64devkit` is installed and added to your system's PATH.
2. Make sure you have properly installed raylib.

## Dependencies

- **raylib**: Make sure the raylib library is properly linked during compilation.
- Any additional dependencies will be listed in the project files.

Feel free to explore the code and contribute if you'd like!
